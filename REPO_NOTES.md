# REPO_NOTES — spec deltas and adaptation decisions

Running log of every place this build adapted REPO_SPEC / RETROSPECTIVE rather
than following them literally (ground rule 1: adapt and log, never silently).
Companion file: `DOC_GAPS.md` (where the docs were wrong/ambiguous); this file
records what I *did* about it.

## Phase 1 — pipeline generalization

1. **`races/nb2026` is a symlink to `examples/nb2026`.** REPO_SPEC's layout has
   race workdirs under `races/<race>/` but places the worked example under
   `examples/nb2026/`; the build prompt invokes `build_data.py races/nb2026/…`.
   One directory, two paths — no duplicated config.

2. **Frozen reference lives at `examples/nb2026/frozen/`, rebuilds at `out/`.**
   REPO_SPEC puts the example's outputs at `examples/nb2026/out/`; but `out/`
   is where the pipeline writes, and the frozen original must stay read-only.
   `frozen/dashboard_data.json` is the byte-exact copy of the shipped payload;
   `out/` is gitignored build product.

3. **Zone bounds: authored, not detected** (`zone_detection.zone` in config).
   REPO_SPEC says the NB2026 park band "becomes an output… not an input
   constant", but the stage-2 §6 threshold algorithm provably cannot emit
   180→80 on this data: fleet-median SOG in band 180–190 nm (5.93 kts) is
   *lower* than in band 80–90 nm (6.15 kts), so no `collapse_frac` includes
   both zone edges while excluding the neighbors (full band table in
   `out/run_log.json`). RETROSPECTIVE §5.3 explicitly classes park bounds as an
   authored analysis framing, and REPO_SPEC's own header says the retro wins on
   conflicts. Resolution: `zones.py` implements spec detection and always logs
   its candidates + band medians; the shipped bounds are recorded per-race
   config (a CP-2 judgment), and `goldens.json` carries `zone_source:
   authored|detected`. With schema-default thresholds, detection finds zero
   qualifying candidates on NB2026 (the only sub-threshold run, band 140–150,
   is ~3 h traversal vs `min_traversal_hours: 6`).

4. **`official_results.csv` columns extended** beyond the REPO_SPEC map with
   `class_rank`, `status`, `retire_reason`. The spec's column list had no way
   to carry DNF rows (4 in NB2026, with authored retirement reasons) or the
   official within-class order (drives `meta.clsPos`).

5. **`events.yaml` is a mapping, not a bare list**: `{events: […], watches:
   […]}`. schemas.md shows only an event list; the worked example also ships
   11 watch spans, which are narrative-layer data with the same
   naive-local-string convention.

6. **Recon output key is config-driven** (`reconcile.matched_key`). The frozen
   payload (and app.js) use `matched_edt`; schemas.md says `matched_local`.
   Parity wins for NB2026; the template default is `matched_local`.

7. **`extra_boats` config addition.** BLACK JACK 100 and OC 86 are tracked but
   outside the scored division — they exist in no results file, so they need a
   config home (track name, display, type, group).

8. **Display normalization applied uniformly.** Legacy applied
   `re.sub(r'\s+',' ')` to finisher display names but not DNF names; the
   pipeline normalizes all (identical output on NB2026 data).

9. **`output.generated` pin.** The payload's `meta.generated` date is pinned in
   the example config ('2026-07-05') so the frozen build reproduces exactly;
   omitted for new races (defaults to build date).

10. **Environment pins + platform float caveat** (`requirements.txt`: pandas
    2.2.3 / numpy 1.26.4). Three env combos (pandas 3.0.3, 2.3.3, 2.2.3) all
    reproduce the frozen payload except **39 of ~2.96 M** lat/lon grid samples,
    every one an exact half-boundary rounding flip (interpolation weight 0.5,
    true value exactly `X.XXXX5`) — 1-ulp platform differences (frozen build:
    Linux x86-64 container) decide which side `round(…, 4)` lands on. Both
    encodings are within half an encoding quantum (~5 m) of the true position.
    See `GATE_A_REPORT.md`. Related: epoch seconds are now computed
    resolution-independently and the yb adapter pins `datetime64[ns]` (pandas
    ≥ 3.0 defaults epoch-seconds to `[s]`, which visibly changes interpolation
    rounding).

11. **Shipped-site defect found during extraction**: `app.js:259` group button
    "Neighbors" lists `'Zélée'` but the data key is `'Zelee'` — the button
    toggles a phantom entry no chart can render. Corrected to `'Zelee'` in
    `presentation.js` (comment at site); becomes a Phase-3 assertion
    (selection-set names ⊆ data keys, stage-2 §9) and is flagged for review at
    GATE B, since it is a deliberate behavior *fix* relative to the shipped site.

12. **Legacy line-ref drift** (prompt/REPO_SPEC vs checkout at `611faf7`):
    events+watches live at `export_json.py:239–302` (cited 239–297); the
    results table at `:27–116` (cited 26–124); parkFair at `:351–370` (cited
    351–361). Adapted by content, not line number.

13. **`time.tz_probe.track_epoch_utc` computed** (1782244492 = 2026-06-23
    19:54:52 UTC): the schema requires it but no provided document recorded it.
    Derived from the official finish 15:54:52 EDT; consistent with the shipped
    title block ("verified against the tracker on the line at 19:55 UTC").

14. **Milestone corrected values route through `scoring.corrected()`** rather
    than a literal `× tcf` — same numbers for `tot` (probe-verified), but the
    milestone series now respects the configured scoring system.

## GATE A adjudication (2026-07-07, coordinating chat session)

15. **Verdict PASS; tie-exemption encoded** — `pipeline/rounding.py` TieTracker
    records every .5-tie rounding site at build time (`out/rounding_ties.json`,
    3090 sites on NB2026); `compare_data.py --ties` exempts a diff iff |Δ| ==
    exactly one quantum AND the path is a recorded tie. 39/39 GATE A diffs
    exempt, 0 real, exit 0. Negative test: a one-quantum shift at a non-tie
    site and a ±1 golden change both fail loudly. No global tolerance change,
    no allowlist.
16. **GATE B builds from the pipeline's emitted payload** (not the frozen
    copy) — adjudication #2; platform/env recorded in run_log.json.
17. **finstrip count: 82, not 81.** The adjudication's harness-porting list
    says "finstrip = 81"; the frozen payload has 82 boats with official
    corrected times (the shipped strip renders 81 dots + the hero diamond —
    likely the source of "81"). Goldens assert 82 scored boats, verified
    against the oracle; flagged for GATE B.
18. **REPO_SPEC v1.1 and the 9/9 harness file were not delivered** with the
    adjudication message (only the three acquisition files arrived). Proceeded
    per the adjudication's own fallback: implementation stands, deltas logged;
    the six harness assertions are ported from the adjudication text itself.
    See DOC_GAPS #14.
19. **Name-hygiene assertions extended to every selection surface** (defaults,
    group buttons, module boat lists) — Phase 3 scope, per adjudication #4.

## Phase 2/3 — shell migration + tests

20. **Packaging: classic scripts + registration, not ESM.** RETROSPECTIVE §2
    sketches `export default` for race config and modules; the shell instead
    uses `window.__RACE_CONFIG__` / `registerModule()` / `registerOverlay()`
    with the ABI **object shapes unchanged**. Why: the standalone single-file
    build stays a trivial script concat (ESM inline imports break on file://),
    and the node harness stays dependency-free. The ctx ABI is frozen as
    implemented in `shell/app/core.js` (`makeCtx`).
21. **copy.js is copy.md's machine form.** The retro's "copy.md (structured
    slots)" is implemented as a hand-derived `copy.js` (`window.__COPY__`);
    copy.md stays the human-readable frozen record. Keeping them in sync is a
    per-race authoring step — candidate for a generator later.
22. **Overlay ABI addition: `mapLayer: under|over|top`** — the shipped map's
    draw order (Gulf Stream under boats, watch segments over boats, nav-log
    fixes over event markers) needs three insertion slots; the retro ABI had
    no ordering hint. Additive, optional (default `over`).
23. **Park SOG shading via config, not module shapes.** Retro §1 says the park
    rects "belong to the park module", but the section-module ABI has no
    chart-shape hook; the shading ships as `charts.parkShading` config read by
    the sog chart (renders only when present + distance axis). Revisit if the
    ABI ever grows a bands hook for section modules.
24. **navlog registers twice** (section: recon table; overlay: map pill +
    fixes) — one feature, two ABI surfaces; the ABI supports it naturally.
25. **presentation.js config additions** discovered during the port:
    `groups.{dnfKey,outsideKey,fallbackKey}`, `eventCategories.*.big` (12/14px
    markers), `charts.{dtf,xte,sog}.eventTopY`, `race.ratingLabel`,
    `controls.pills` (pill row order incl. shell pills '@ghosts'/'@rhumb'),
    `layout` (section order incl. module mounts + 'two:' column pairing),
    `course.dtfStartFallback`, `meta.twitterDescription`.
26. **Two stylesheets** (tokens.css + styles.css) replace the single
    styles.css; build.py stamps and inlines both.
27. **Harness invocation**: `node tests/test_dashboard.js <race_dir>
    [regression.json]` against `dist/standalone.html` (embedded data → no
    fetch mocks), not REPO_SPEC's `<built.html> <goldens.json>` positional
    pair. Fixtures live at `races/<race>/tests/regression.json` (prompt wins
    over REPO_SPEC's `tests/goldens/<race>.json`). 11 fixed-count assertions
    across the four I10 categories; the count itself is asserted so a skipped
    block fails loudly. Verified green under both TZ=America/New_York and
    TZ=UTC; the tampered-golden path refuses the build.
