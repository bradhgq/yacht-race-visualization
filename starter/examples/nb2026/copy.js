(Computed from positions; the tracker has no wind data, so this is VMC to the mark, not wind-VMG.) Sunday check: at equal distance sailed, RAGANA still gained — the post-shift beat was a lifted fetch for the whole comparison set, and the gain was boatspeed (7.6 vs 6.2 kt on the rating twin), not shorter routing.' },

  footer: `<h3>How to read this</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The race chart</b> plots, at each 10-nm distance-to-finish milestone, one boat's time minus a reference boat's — negative means ahead. <b>Corrected</b> applies each boat's handicap (the actual competition); <b>elapsed</b> is raw boat-for-boat position on the water. Endpoints at the finish are exact from official results; the points between are tracker estimates.</li>
    <li><b>The park table</b> measures each boat's own traversal of the slow zone, so it compares like with like regardless of when a boat got there.</li>
    <li>Start-sequence differences (classes started 13:40–14:30) are removed from the race chart. Two boats are named Phoenix — USA25329 (J/120, 45th) is in the quick-select; USA93063 (First 40.7, 24th) is under "+ More."</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sources &amp; method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>YB tracker export (252,046 positions, 144 boats, ~5-min interval); the boat's nav log; the Commanders' Weather routing brief; and "The Gulf Stream Show" daily broadcast plus the pre-race Navigators' Forum. Speed is derived from position over a centered 30-min window; distance-to-finish and rhumb offset by great-circle math against a finish line triangulated from six boats' official finish times. Race timing verified EDT. Gulf Stream band is approximate, drawn from RAGANA's own sea-temperature log — not an oceanographic product.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>On the wishlist for a future round</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>NOAA Gulf Stream overlay · GFS wind underlay · animated time scrubber · synced hover across charts.</li>
