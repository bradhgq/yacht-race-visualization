# starter/ — the race-viz engine

The reusable code that turns a race's `config.yaml` + tracker export into a built
dashboard. Generalized from the RAGANA · Newport Bermuda 2026 worked example
(now `races/nb2026/`). This directory is **raw code only** — the process/judgment
layer is [`skills/race-viz/`](../skills/race-viz/SKILL.md), the docs are
[`docs/`](../docs/), and races live in [`races/`](../races/), all at the repo root.

## Layout

```
shell/        generalized dashboard shell — index.template.html, styles/tokens,
              app/ (core.js + charts/), build.py, INVARIANTS.md
pipeline/     build_data / scoring / zones / reconcile / route / compare_data
adapters/     tracker-vendor format PARSERS → canonical track schema (adapters/README.md)
acquisition/  race-data DOWNLOADERS — fetch raw data from YB / YachtScoring (network)
tests/        parameterized JS regression harness (test_dashboard.js) + route tests
requirements.txt
```

`adapters/` vs `acquisition/`: acquisition *fetches* (network → raw files); adapters
*parse* a vendor's raw format into the canonical schema `pipeline/` consumes.

## Build a race (run from the repo root)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r starter/requirements.txt   # once
.venv/bin/python starter/build_race.py races/<race>     # ONE command, always the full chain
```

`build_race.py` runs, in order: `pipeline/build_data.py` → the race's
`postprocess.py` (if any) → `shell/build.py` (refuses dist on a red harness,
I10; `TZ=America/New_York`) → the harness again under `TZ=UTC` →
`pipeline/compare_data.py` vs `frozen/` (tie-exempt). Piecemeal invocation
invites the stale-standalone trap — dist embeds `out/`, tests read dist.

`build_data.py` refuses to run fleet math until ≥2 probe boats reproduce their
official corrected times within 1 s, and writes a run log (invocation + input
hashes) next to every payload — shipped numbers come only from the pipeline
(prime rule 1).

## Starting a new race

Copy [`starter/template/`](template/) to `races/<race>/`, drop the tracker
export / results / scratch sheet into `raw/`, fill `config.yaml` (facts only —
narrative goes in `events.yaml`) plus `presentation.js`, then run the one-command
chain. See the skill's
stage files for the checkpoint protocol; never skip CP-0 or CP-2.

Living logs live in [`docs/`](../docs/): `REPO_NOTES.md` (standing decisions and
open threads only — closed items are deleted, git history is the archive) and
`DOC_GAPS.md` (open documentation gaps only).
