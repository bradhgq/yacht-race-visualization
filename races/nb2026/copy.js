(Computed from positions; the tracker has no wind data, so this is VMC to the mark, not wind-VMG.)

Each dot is a scored St. David’s boat — how far it actually sailed (the vertical line is the 635 nm rhumb, the theoretical minimum) against how fast it went (distance sailed ÷ official elapsed, so the grey rays through the origin are lines of equal finish time — boats on the same ray finished the same water in the same time, and up-and-left wins). Distance right of the line is miles a boat chose, or was forced, to sail beyond the direct course; height above the ray it started on is speed that paid for them. RAGANA bought 52 extra miles; this chart shows who bought their miles cheaply and who paid for miles that never paid back. (Boudicca, a much larger Class-8 boat, is a genuine speed outlier and sits off the top of the elapsed scale — not a peer; switch to corrected to see the fleet on one scale.)',

  footer: `<h3>How to read this</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The race chart</b> plots, at each 10-nm distance-to-finish milestone, one boat's time minus a reference boat's — negative means ahead. <b>Corrected</b> applies each boat's handicap (the actual competition); <b>elapsed</b> is raw boat-for-boat position on the water. Endpoints at the finish are exact from official results; the points between are tracker estimates.</li>
    <li><b>The park table</b> measures each boat's own traversal of the slow zone, so it compares like with like regardless of when a boat got there.</li>
    <li>Start-sequence differences (classes started 13:40–14:30) are removed from the race chart. Two boats are named Phoenix — USA25329 (J/120, 45th) is in the quick-select; USA93063 (First 40.7, 24th) is under "+ More."</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sources &amp; method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>YB tracker export (252,046 positions, 144 boats, ~5-min interval); the boat's nav log; the Commanders' Weather routing brief; and "The Gulf Stream Show" daily broadcast plus the pre-race Navigators' Forum. Speed is derived from position over a centered 30-min window; distance-to-finish and rhumb offset by great-circle math against a finish line triangulated from six boats' official finish times. Race timing verified EDT. Gulf Stream band is approximate, drawn from RAGANA's own sea-temperature log — not an oceanographic product.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>On the wishlist for a future round</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>NOAA Gulf Stream overlay · GFS wind underlay · animated time scrubber · synced hover across charts.</li>
