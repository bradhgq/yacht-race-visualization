  footer: `<h3>How to read this</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Two focuses, no duel.</b> Daffodil (the only multihull entered; the owner crewed her) and Max (overall winner) are told in parallel — same water, same weather, different problems. Their curves are never a head-to-head.</li>
  <li><b>The door, not the margin.</b> Max, Phantom and Wahoo finished within 4:50 corrected after 27 hours — inside the ~10-minute rating noise floor for a 207 nm time-on-distance race. The verifiable difference is timing: only three boats finished before the squall line entered the Sound, Max last among them by 80 minutes, hours before the post-frontal calm shut the last 15 nm.</li>
  <li><b>Daffodil's race in one line:</b> fourth-fastest of 43 through the ocean reach (8¼ h where the fleet median was 12), a clean Montauk corner, then a trimaran's worst mode — a light-air beat down the Sound — and a shut door. Rumours of dismastings in the squall remain rumours: no track shows one, and no boat is named.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sources &amp; method</h3>

  <li>YB tracker (race alir25) and YachtScoring event 50029, re-downloaded and verified identical to the July 2025 originals; official Sailing Instructions v1.3 for the course and the 207 nm scoring distance.</li>
  <li>Weather evidence: NOAA buoys 44065/44025, Kings Point; NWS OKX event page for 25 July 2025; ERA5 reanalysis (model — the Montauk corner and central Sound had no working 2025 wind platform); NOAA current predictions for Plum Gut. Wind claims from model data say so.</li>
  <li>Corrected times reproduce the official results exactly (time-on-distance, rating × 207 nm, verified for all 43 finishers). Distances-remaining are routed along the course polyline. Timezone verified by finish-line probe on five boats.</li>
