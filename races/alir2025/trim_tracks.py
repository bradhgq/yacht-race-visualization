"""Trim each boat's track to its own racing window — the de-noise step.

A tracker is switched on before the boat leaves the dock and often stays on for
the delivery home, so a raw export carries two kinds of non-race motion that
corrupt fleet-frame views: pre-start milling about, and post-finish (or
post-retirement) travel. On ALIR 2025 the worst case is Scarlett, who retired
off Fire Island and whose tracker then travelled up the Hudson to Kingston NY —
468 pings north of 41.3N, stretching the fleet bounding box by ~38 nm. Dolcezza
kept transmitting for 9 hours after finishing.

Excluding such boats would be wrong: they raced. Trimming is the honest fix.

Per boat, keep pings in [start_cut, end_cut]:

  start_cut = that boat's division start (official finish - elapsed, read on the
              EDT-mislabelled results clock and converted to true UTC) minus
              PRE_PAD. Boats with no results row keep the global race start.

  end_cut   = for a FINISHER, her official finish time plus POST_PAD — the exact
              instant is published, so use it rather than inferring one.
              For a boat with no finish (RET/DNC), the moment she reached her
              MINIMUM routed distance-to-finish, plus POST_PAD: the furthest she
              ever got. Everything after that is motion away from the finish —
              delivery, tow, or trailer.
              (Minimum-DTF is deliberately NOT used for finishers: the routed
              model clamps distance to zero once a boat is abeam of the finish
              waypoint, which can precede the actual line crossing by minutes.)

Distance-to-finish is computed with the same `pipeline.route.Course` the
pipeline uses, from the same config polyline, so the trim and the analysis agree
on what "toward the finish" means.
