    // CP-3 amendment (decisions/CP-3-amendment-park-copy.yaml): 19–39% was
    // 16–38%, third-slowest was second-slowest — the old values quoted the
    // debrief's 18-boat comparison set above this displayed default-12 table.
    note: 'Comparing "the park" by wall-clock window is misleading: faster boats clear the light air before slower boats reach it, so you end up comparing different water. This table instead measures the empirically slow zone — the 180-to-80-nm-to-go band, with a dead core around 140–160 where the fleet-median speed bottomed at 3.3 kts — as each boat actually traversed it, on its own clock. The finding: everyone parked (19–39% of each run under 4 kts), the whole set’s traversal times fall within 5.5 hours of each other, and RAGANA’s 27.9 hours was third-slowest — an honest gap of two to four hours from the most easterly lane, with an instrument failure and a sail repair both landing inside the dead core.',
