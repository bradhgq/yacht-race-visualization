# Contracts & templates

Boundary rule: **facts about the race → `config.yaml`; judgment about races → the skill; code → the repo.** Narrative content is data (`events.yaml`), never pipeline code.

## config.yaml — per-race facts

`races/_template/config.yaml` is the fill-me copy of this schema, kept in
lockstep: when the pipeline grows a key, the template and this block move
together (DOC_GAPS #6 — the first cold-start had to reverse-engineer a dozen
keys from pipeline code). The pace endpoint golden
(`endpoints.pace_min_per_100`) is deliberately NOT a config.yaml key: it lives
in `tests/regression.json` only, asserted from the rendered traces by the
harness; `shell/build.py`'s consistency check cross-checks just
ref/corrected_min/elapsed_min between config and fixtures.

**Presentation config is a separate file** — `races/<race>/presentation.js`
(`window.__RACE_CONFIG__`): layout/section order, palette + group presentation,
defaults, chart y-ranges + heights, KPI slots, `modules`/`overlays` lists, and
the selection filters (`classFilter: { prefix, inputLabel, placeholder }` and
`ratingBands: { widths: [...] }`, std since R2 — presence of a block renders
its control; absence renders nothing, so one-design races simply omit them).
Facts shared with `config.yaml` (course, hero/client boat, time) must MATCH —
`shell/build.py` runs a consistency check and refuses the build on divergence.
Narrative copy lives in `copy.js`/`copy.md`, never in either config. The worked
example (`races/nb2026/presentation.js`) documents every key with its origin.

## events.yaml — narrative as data

```yaml
- t: "2026-06-20 03:30"         # official-TZ local, naive string
  cat: crew                     # crew | systems | sail | tactics | insight | milestone
  label: ""
  txt: ""
  source: journal               # journal | navlog | transcript | analysis
  visibility: private           # private | public — public requires a CP-5 opt-in
```

## Decision-record templates — `decisions/CP-*.yaml`

Emit as a fenced YAML block in chat, filled as a draft for the user to confirm or edit; the confirmed block is the artifact. When a repo exists, write confirmed records to `decisions/`.

```yaml

## Findings-memo format (stage-2 output)

1. **Headline candidates** — for each: claim / evidence pointer (chart or values) / confidence / benchmark-dependence note.
2. **Proposed race-unique modules** — which heuristic fired, with its evidence.
3. **Data-quality anomalies.**
4. **Open questions** for the user.
5. The CP-2 form, ready to confirm.

## Discrepancy-register row (stage-3 output)

| claim | source | what the track shows | verdict | note |
Verdicts: confirmed / contradicted / partial / unresolvable.

## Claude Code PROMPT.md skeleton (stage-5 handoff)

```markdown
# <RACE> dashboard — productionize

## Context
<race, edition, tier, client boat, where the project stands, repo layout>

## Invariants — violating any of these is a failed handoff
- Timezone-naive rendering: chart x-values are naive local strings; never Date objects.
- Chart endpoints are exact official-results values.
- State-model conventions: <one state object, pure build*() re-renders, axis helpers>.
- The shell invariant list (shell/INVARIANTS.md, I1–I18) — I5–I13 and I15–I18 govern productionization work.
- Golden values (frozen): <paste the config goldens block>.
- <anything added during CP-4 rounds>

## Do not touch
Golden values; dashboard_data.json semantics; module math.

## Jobs
Mobile breakpoints; lazy-loading; performance budget; hosting; accessibility.

## Protocol
Run the full chain — `.venv/bin/python starter/build_race.py races/<race>` (harness under both
TZ=America/New_York and TZ=UTC, then the frozen-oracle compare) — BEFORE starting and AFTER
finishing: all green both times. Any newly human-caught defect becomes a new assertion.
